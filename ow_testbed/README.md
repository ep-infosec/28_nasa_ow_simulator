The Notices and Disclaimers for Ocean Worlds Autonomy Testbed for Exploration
Research and Simulation can be found in README.md in the root directory of
this repository.

ow_testbed
==================================
This package contains an early attempt at modeling a physical testbed from JPL.
It was never completed. It would be possible to make it work as part of
OceanWATERS, but this would take considerable effort due to differences in the
structure of the robot arm compared to the arm in `ow_lander`. Other parts of
OceanWATERS would need to be generalized to handle multiple robots.
